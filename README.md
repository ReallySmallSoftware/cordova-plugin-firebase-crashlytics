# Cordova Firebase Crashlytics Plugin

A Google Firebase Crashlytics plugin to enable capture of crash reports.

# What is Crashlytics?

From the Google documentation (https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics/):

> Firebase Crashlytics helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode app quality, in realtime. Spend less time triaging and troubleshooting crashes and more time building app features that delight users

# Supported platforms
This plugin supports the following platforms:

- Android
- iOS (untested)
- Browser (for testing only)

# Installation

`cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-firebase-crashlytics --variable ANDROID_FIREBASE_CORE_VERSION=16.0.0 --save`

or

`phonegap plugin add cordova-plugin-firebase-crashlytics --variable ANDROID_FIREBASE_CORE_VERSION=16.0.0`

Omitting `FIREBASE_VERSION` will use a default value.

## Firebase configuration
### Android

You must ensure that `google-services.json` is put in the correct location. This can be achieved using the following in your `config.xml`:

```
<platform name="android">
    <resource-file src="google-services.json" target="google-services.json" />
</platform>
```

#### Dependencies
##### cordova-support-google-services

In order to ensure Firebase initialises correctly on Android this plugin can be used. This is not automatically added as a dependency to allow for the configuration it performs to be done manually if desired.

### iOS
iOS requires `GoogleService-Info.plist` is put in the correct location. Similarly this can be done as follows:
```
<platform name="ios">
    <resource-file src="GoogleService-Info.plist" />
</platform>
```

#### Podfile configuration
At this time it is necessary to manually add the `use_frameworks!` directive to this file.

#### Keychain Sharing Capability
If using multiple Firebase plugins it may be necessary to enable this.

# How to use it
Simply add the plugin to get the default Crashlytics functionality. Note that crashes and logged exceptions will only be reported when the application restarts.

In order to log caught exceptions the following can be used:

```
var crashlytics = FirebaseCrashlytics.initialise();
crashlytics.logException("my caught exception");
```
